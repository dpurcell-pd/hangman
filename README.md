Hangman

This application represents a barebones version of the classic Hangman game, presented as a single player game and playable
one round at a time.

Technologies used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Web Browser (required for DOM manipulation)

Application Summary:

The user will have an opportunity to enter their name, after which they will be presented with a series of blanks representing a word they must guess. 
Each New Game will allow the player a total of seven guesses to guess the word, either letter by letter or all at once. 

While a new game is in play, the player is always shown their number of remaining guesses, and their completed word so far. 

Empty guesses and repeat letter guesses are allowed, but count towards your total guesses.
